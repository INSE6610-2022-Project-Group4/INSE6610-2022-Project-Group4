# INSE6610-2022-Project-Group4
A comprehensive review of Cyber-attacks: Case studies on The Melissa Virus, Target (2013), and JP Morgan (2014)

This document provides the description of our group project for the INSE 6610 course under the guidance of our instructor, Professor Ivan Pustogarov. (Summer 2022, Concordia University).

We will be conducting research work on the cyber-attacks mentioned above. The research will enable us to provide a comprehensive case study on the chosen attacks. 
As a team, we will gather information from various sources such as books, internet sites, public reports, and court proceedings. 
All the information will be compiled in a concise case study, covering all the important elements of each attack, its discovery, investigation and outcome.
